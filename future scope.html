                The world's total population touched 6.60 billion in 2000 but is projected to grow to 9.32 billion by 2050. Hence, it is necessary to increase the yield on the limited farmland.

</font></u></b></a></h1>
<li style="text-align:justify"> A unified solution which can be integrated with different types of IoT devices.
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"> The most common challenge for the Internet of Things in agriculture is connectivity. Every area doesn’t have proper internet connectivity.
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"> The second most common challenge for IoT based Smart Farming is the lack of awareness among consumers.
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"> Due to various service providers, it becomes really difficult to maintain interoperability between different IoT systems.
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"> A scalable solution that can be integrated with thousands of IoT devices for large farms.
</li>
<h1 class="post-title"><a href="#"><b><u><font style="color:green;">Solutions for Building IoT based Smart Farming</u></font></u></b></a></h1>
<li style="text-align:justify"> Smart Farming has enabled farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc.) and automation of irrigation systems. Further with the help of these sensors, farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. IoT based Smart Farming is highly efficient when compared with the conventional approach. The applications of IoT-based Agriculture solutions not only targets conventional, large farming. With operations, but could also be new levers to uplift other growing or common trends in agricultural like organic farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures, preservation of specific or high-quality varieties, etc.), and enhance highly transparent Farming.
</li>
<h1 class="post-title"><a href="#"><u><h4><b><font style="color:green;">Applications of IoT in Smart Farming</font></b>
</h4></u></b></a></h1>
<li style="text-align:justify"> In IoT based smart agriculture, a system is formed to monitor the farmland with the help of sensors, which senses components like temperature, light, humidity, soil moisture, etc. Then, automate the irrigation system and allow farmers to monitor their field conditions from anywhere through IoT Analytics Platform. To make the agricultural process even smarter and accurate, precision agriculture is used. This makes agricultural practice more controlled and precise in terms of raising livestock and farming. IoT based Smart Farming plays a vital role when it comes to the use of IT and other elements like sensors, agricultural drones,  autonomous vehicles, control systems, automated hardware, robotics,  variable speed technology, and others.
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify">The below highlighted are the applications of IoT in smart farming:
</li>
<h5><b><font style="color:rgb(231, 72, 19);">Weather Monitoring:</font></b></h5>
<li style="text-align:justify">Weather plays a very significant role when it comes to the Agriculture sector. In agriculture, there is almost everything dependable upon the climate condition. In smart Farming, temperature humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture can be monitored through various sensors. These are again used by the reactive system to trigger alerts or automate the process such as water and air control.
</li>
<h5><b><font style="color:rgb(231, 72, 19);">Smart Irrigation on Agriculture land:</font></b></h5>
<li style="text-align:justify">In smart irrigation, automated sprinkler systems or smart pumps are used. Soil moistures sensors are used in different areas to get the moisture of the soil in agricultural land. Based on the results from the soil moisture sensors, the smart pumps or smart sprinklers are turned On/Off.
</li>
<h5><b><font style="color:rgb(231, 72, 19);">Monitoring Soil Quality:</font></b></h5>
<li style="text-align:justify">Farmers usually use a sampling method to calculate soil fertility, moisture content. Fortunately, this sampling doesn’t give accurate results as chemical decomposition varies from location to location. Meanwhile, this not much helpful. To resolve this thing, IoT plays an essential role in Farming. Sensors can be installed at a uniform distance across the length and breadth of the farmland to collect the accurate soil data, which can be further used in the dashboard or mobile application for the farm monitoring.
</li>
<h5><b><font style="color:rgb(231, 72, 19);">Livestock Monitoring:</font></b></h5>
<li style="text-align:justify">IoT devices can be used to collect data regarding the location, well-being, and the health of the cattle. This data can be further used for identification of the sick animals so that they can be separated from the others, thereby preventing the spread of diseases. This Live Stock Monitoring also lowers the labor costs with the help of IoT based sensors.
</li>
<h5><b><font style="color:rgb(231, 72, 19);">Drone Monitoring:</font></b></h5>
<li style="text-align:justify">Drone monitoring is helping large farms to reduce the cost of monitoring, or the use of Geo-positioning sensors can set a stable path. Moreover, the data collected from these drones are sent back to the server where it can be used for analyzing and decision-making.
